-- When UTF8-encoding a string, surrogate code points and other non-characters
-- are simply replaced by the replacement character ï¿½ (U+FFFD).
-- This entails that the `encodeUtf8` function is not injective anymore and
-- thus the desired property `decodeUtf8 <<< encodeUtf8 == id` does not hold
-- in general.
--
-- For well-formed input strings, however, we can expect the property to hold.

-- Use a newtype in order to define an `Arbitrary` instance.
newtype WellFormedInput = WellFormedInput String

-- The `Arbitrary` instance for `String` currently simply chooses characters
-- out of the first 65536 unicode code points.
-- See `charGen` in `purescript-strongcheck`.
